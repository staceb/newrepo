To make the index number easier to read and display, the index number for hardened children is displayed starting from zero, but with a prime symbol. The first normal child key is therefore displayed as 0, whereas the first hardened child (index 0x80000000) is displayed as 0&#x27;. In sequence then, the second hardened key would have index 0x80000001 and would be displayed as 1&#x27;, and so on. When you see an HD wallet index i&#x27;, that means 231+i.
